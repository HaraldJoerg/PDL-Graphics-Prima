PDL::Graphics::Prima - a graphing widget using the Prima toolkit.

At this point I have split the PDL-Prima bindings into a seperate distribution
called PDL::Drawing::Prima. This distribution provides the graphing widget, which
is a whole complicated collection of modules. The development of these
modules was stagnating the development of the drawing distribution, which is
why I pulled them into their own seperate distribution.
