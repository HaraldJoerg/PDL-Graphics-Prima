PDL::Graphics::Prima
====================

A PDL graphing library using the Prima toolkit.


This collection of modules that provides a PDL-centric 2D graphing library
that is fast, intelligent, multi-platform and highly interactive. Fast
because it's built on the PDL::Drawing::Prima bindings, which make use of
the PDL threading engine to quickly execute large sets of drawing operations.
Intelligent because I have put a lot of thought into important behavior like
autoscaling and smart tick marking and they Do The Right Thing almost every
time, without the need for manual manipulation. Multi-platform and highly
interactive because it is built upon Prima, the Perl-centric multi-platform
set of drawing functions and GUI toolkit, and because interactive behavior
like panning and zooming are built right into the widget.

For more information, see the documentation for PDL::Graphics::Prima.


INSTALLATION
============

There are a number of ways to install this module. The simplest is to
install it using CPAN:

	cpan PDL::Graphics::Prima

If you have your hands on the actual source code (or you "look"ed at this
module from the CPAN shell), you would do the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Note that there are almost no tests for this distribution at the moment.
Frankly, I'm not sure exactly to go about testing this sort of distribution.
Patches welcome! However, there are a number of example (and as such, test
scripts) in the test/ directory in the source distribution if you want to
take the library for a spin.


DEPENDENCIES
============

This module depends on the Perl Data Language, specifically version 2.4.10.
As of the time of writing, that has not yet been released, which means you
will need a developer's release of PDL, or a clone of the latest developer's
repository. This is needed because it uses whereND, and that was introduced
after the release of 2.4.9.

This module also depends on PDL::Drawing::Prima, which itself depends on
the Prima toolkit. You will almost certainly need a C compiler to install
these.
