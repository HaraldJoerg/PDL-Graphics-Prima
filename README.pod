PDL::Graphics::Prima
====================

A PDL graphing library using the Prima toolkit.

This collection of modules provides a PDL-centric 2D graphing library that
is fast, intelligent, multi-platform and highly interactive. Fast because
it's built on the PDL::Drawing::Prima bindings, which make use of the PDL
threading engine to quickly execute large sets of drawing operations.
Intelligent because I have put a lot of thought into important behavior like
autoscaling and smart tick marking and they Do The Right Thing almost every
time, without the need for manual manipulation. Multi-platform and highly
interactive because it is built upon Prima, the Perl-centric multi-platform
set of drawing functions and GUI toolkit, and because interactive behavior
like panning and zooming are built right into the widget.

For more information, see the documentation for PDL::Graphics::Prima. If
you're new, you should check out the documentation for
PDL::Graphics::Prima::Simple. I have also posted a YouTube video
demonstrating a number of cool features of the library at
http://youtu.be/WILd2XTz3F4.

DEVELOPMENT STATUS
==================

This project is currently in alpha. I say this not because the software is
unstable to execute but because the API is likely to undergo some
substantial revisions under this name. Once the interface has settled down,
all future API changes will go under a seperate name, likely
PDL::Graphics::Prima2.

In other words, please play around with this library and use it if you like,
but please *do not* use it in code that you plan to run unmodified next
month. (Unfortunately, I still need to go through my code base and update
code that is about to or has already broken.)

DEPENDENCIES
============

This module depends on PDL::Drawing::Prima. As that module is strongly
intertwined with this one, I have provided instructions for installing it
in the INSTALLATION section. PDL::Drawing::Prima depends on the Perl Data
Language version 2.4.10. 2.4.10 is still in testing, so as of the time of
writing you'll need to download and install the current developers release.
PDL::Drawing::Prima also depends on Prima, a Perl GUI toolkit.

PDL::Graphics::Prima requires Perl 5.10, although it will soon be relaxed to
Perl 5.8. If you don't have that version of Perl, I recommend installing
Strawberry Perl if you're on Windows, or using perlbrew if you're on Linux
or Mac.

PDL::Drawing::Prima (and a CPAN install of PDL and Prima) requires a C
compiler. If you're on Linux, you'll also need your X11 headers to compile
Prima.

INSTALLATION
============

To instal the latest deveoper's release of PDL, Launch CPAN and type this:

 cpan> get  CHM/PDL-2.4.9_010.tar.gz
 cpan> make CHM/PDL-2.4.9_010.tar.gz
 cpan> test CHM/PDL-2.4.9_010.tar.gz
 cpan> install CHM/PDL-2.4.9_010.tar.gz

From the same shell, you should also install Prima:

 cpan> instal Prima

With those in place, you can proceed to download and install PDL::*::Prima.
From your prompt (you'll need git for this), pull the two repositories:

 > git pull git://github.com/run4flat/PDL-Drawing-Prima.git
 > git pull git://github.com/run4flat/PDL-Graphics-Prima.git

Build and install PDL::Drawing::Prima:

 > cd PDL-Drawing-Prima
 > perl Makefile.PL
 > make     ( or nmake or dmake on Windows as appropriate)
 > make install

Try running the examples for the Drawing library if you like. Then, build 
and run (and install, if you like) PDL::Graphics::Prima:

 > cd ../PDL-Graphics-Prima
 > perl Makefile.PL
 > make

At this point, there are no tests for PDL::Graphics::Prima. There are,
however, many examples under the inappropriately named test/ directory. I
recommend trying them out, and examining the code if you want to see how
the library works:

 > perl test/test-error-bars.pl

EVENTUAL INSTRUCTIONS
=====================

These are the instructions that I wrote earlier, in anticipation of
releasing this to CPAN. I retain them here to minimize my effort when I 
release this project to Bet.

There are a number of ways to install this module. The simplest is to
install it using CPAN:

	cpan PDL::Graphics::Prima

If you have your hands on the actual source code (or you "look"ed at this
module from the CPAN shell), you would do the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

Note that there are almost no tests for this distribution at the moment.
Frankly, I'm not sure exactly to go about testing this sort of distribution.
Patches welcome! However, there are a number of example (and as such, test
scripts) in the test/ directory in the source distribution if you want to
take the library for a spin.
