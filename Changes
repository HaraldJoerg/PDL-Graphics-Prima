0.14 DAY, MTH ##, 2013

  [DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR]
  
  * The rainbow palette now runs for hue values from 0 to 300 instead of 0 to
    360. The problem with the original behavior is that the smallest and largest
    values were nearly identical, and indistinguishable. However, it also
    removes a sixth of the color spectrum from the palette.
  
  [NEW FEATURES]
  
  * Added tick labeling callback (thanks Vikas!). Now users can specify an
    arbitrary tick labeling function that will be called for each tick that 
    needs to be labeled, allowing the user to return a string with the desired 
    label.
  
  * Added pal::RainbowSV to make less-than-bright rainbow palettes eaiser to
    create.
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Added a Changes file.
  
  * Made file output *much* more robust. Postscript and raster file outputs now
    give results that look nearly identical or identical compared with the
    figure in the original plot window. Also, a window is not created
    unnecessarily if the script only uses Prima to create the images.
  
  * Added proper handling of weird/bad values for annotation positions. Now, if
    you specify a position that includes 'bad, 'inf', or 'nan', the annotation
    machinery will Just Work, by skipping the annotation drawing.
  
  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Fixed png and ps example scripts. These spuriously called PDL::IO::Pic due
    some experiments I was running. These changes never should have gone into
    the distribution. Oops.



0.13 Wed, Mar 13, 2013

  XXX WORKING HERE



0.12 Mon, Jan 21, 2013

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Included PDL::Graphics::Prima::ReadLine in the MANIFEST file.



0.11 Sun, Jan 20, 2013

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Inherited autoscaling now works with Callback plot type.
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * We now have usable postscript output, though it's not perfect.

0.10 ** SKIPPED **

  * Another version bump gone awry.



0.09 Mon, Aug 6, 2012

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * Finally got save-to-image behavior working, thanks to Dmitry!
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * PDL::Drawing::Prima saw an extensive overhaul with the release of PDP v0.07,
    one which handles singular as well as plural properties, and correctly
    restores the canvas state after the drawing operation is complete. That
    allowed me to simplify the canvas property handling in PDL::Graphics::Prima.
    It also means that singular properties Just Work now! :-D



0.08 Sun, Jul 1, 2012

  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Build.PL is more specific about its requirements.
  
  * Super-simple pairwise api functions now accept single piddles as arguments,
    taking them as y-values and creating sequential x-values.



0.07 Mon, Jun 25, 2012

  [BUG FIXES]
  
  * The Palette suffered a divide by zero bug when sent data with identical
    values. Also, empty piddles sent to Palette are now handled more gracefully.
  
  * Linear scaling now handles degenerate input more gracefully. In particular,
    when the data is all the same *negative* value, it now gives useful minima
    and maxima.
  
  * A recent revision in x autoscaling generated a bug in y autoscaling, such
    that y-axes would autoscale even when I explicitly set their min and/or max.
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * The plot constructor now accepts axis objects. Before, it only accepted a
    hash with the axis properties.
  
  * Histogram autoscaling now performs the correct threaded calculations.
  
  [NEW FEATURES]
  
  * Added image_plot to the Simple interface.



0.06 ** SKIPPED **

  * I hadn't realized that I had already incremented the version number. Oops.



0.05 Thu, Mar 15, 2012

  * Minor docs typo fixes and bug fixes



0.04 Wed, Feb 29, 2012

  * Differentiated datasets and introduced short-form dataset constructors.
  
  * Switched name from pseq::<Type> to ppair::<Type>.
  
  * Lots of naming consolidation.
  
  [ENHANCEMENTS]
  
  * Added first tests to check that the modules load.
  
  * Smooth axis movement.
  
  * Improved autoscaling.
  
  [NEW FEATURES]
  
  * Added ds::Func, ds::Image, and ds::Grid.
  
  * Added pimage::Basic and pgrid::matrix.
  
  * Preliminary postscript output.
  


Entries below are in reverse chronological order, newest first, with significant
dates noted for historical reasons.

0.01 Thu, Dec 22, 2011

  * Added pt::NGons, renamed to pt::Symbols; added lots of derived plot types;
    added pt::TrendLines.
  
  * Simple API now includes plot, line_plot, circle plot, triangle_plot,
    square_plot, diamond_plot, cross_plot, X_plot, asterisk_plot, hist_plot,
    matrix_plot, and func_plot.
  
  * Right-click menu added.
  
  * Postscript and clipboard output added.

Tue, Oct 25, 2011

  * Windows is now preliminarily supported.
  
  * DataSets are now plotted in asciibetical order, by name.

Wed, Oct 19, 2011

  * Added PDL::Graphics::Prima::Simple and PDL::Graphics::Prima::Palette.
  
  * Pushed label handling from a plot responsibility to an axis responsibility.
  
  * Implemented collation-based autoscaling.

Tue, Sep 20, 2011

  * Added pt::Spikes, pt::CallBack, pt::ErrorBars, pt::ColorGrid
  
  * Switched DataSet handling from being a tied array to a tied hash.
  
  * Renamed from Prima::Ex::Graph to PDL::Graphics::Prima and shuffled the files
    into a more standard CPAN distribution layout.
  
  * Moved PDL::PP code into PDL::Drawing::Prima
  
  * Added logarithmic scaling

Thu, Feb 3, 2011

  * First realization as a widget is completed under the name Prima::Ex::Graph.
    The primary components of the library included Axis.pm, DataSet.pm,
    Graph.pm, Limits.pm, PlotType.pm, Scaling.pm, and pdlprima.pd.
  
  * Plot types included pt::Lines, pt::Blobs, and pt::Histogram
  
  * Scaling.pm included linear scaling, but not yet logarithmic.

Thu, Jan 20, 2011

  * Basic line plotting, histogram binning and drawing, and axes scaling and
    tick drawing were prototyped in per-widget onDraw callbacks. These callbacks
    were added systematically to a widget via the endow_widget function.
  
  * Very first plotting interface was a Prima::Drawable method called graph(),
    followed shortly by an additional Drawable method called bin()

Wed, Jan 15, 2011

  * Initially conceived as PDL::PrimaPoly, a set of PDL bindings to Prima's
    polyline method. This would eventually grow into PDL::Drawing::Prima.
